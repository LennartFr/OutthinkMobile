## 1) Use Mobile App Builder to create a Client App (See previous chart)

    [Test Mobile App Builder]: https://www.mozilla.orghttps://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/mobile/

# 2) Use IBM Mobile Dashboard Store Catalog Backend from https://github.com/ibm-bluemix-mobile-services
    It uses an API Connect and Node.js runtime with the Cloudant NoSQL DB, Object Storage, Mobile 
    Client Access, Push Notifications, and Mobile Analytics services on Bluemix. 

   The template exhibits common architectural design patterns that developers can use to model their backend    
   on Bluemix for mobile applications. 
 
   This backend has been created to support the new IBM Mobile Dashboard Store Catalog template. It has 
   the ability to browse a list of products and supports the viewing of images for each item in the product list
